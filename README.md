## Overview

TaskManager is written in Python 3.9+, using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [discord-py-slash-command](https://github.com/eunwoo1104/discord-py-slash-command) libraries.
It's designed for teams to keep track of their active tasks without leaving Discord. With this bot in your server, you can:
- Have multiple teams per server and per user;
- Create, edit and delete tasks;
- View and filter through your active tasks;
- Receive notifications for your tasks in three different moments, or opt out of each one of those;
- Create and grant your server members control roles that determine which permissions they have over the bot's features;
- Have support for two different date and time formats and any timezone;
- And more...

## Setup

To get the bot up and running, simply invite it to your server, create and join a team and start creating your tasks.
You may also want to change the server locale and timezone (default is en-US and EST). These steps are all laid before you as you use the bot.

Bot interaction is done through slash commands, so type / in the chat and wait for the command list to show up.

If you wish to host the bot yourself, you'll need to create a hidden.py module inside the /src directory containing this:

```python
TOKEN = 'your-API-token-here'
FEEDBACK_CHANNEL_ID = 0  # Change for the ID of the channel you wish to use for user feedback.
DEVELOPER_IDS = []  # Fill with the ID of users you want to have developer-level access to the bot.
```

Afterwards, create the /data directory in the project root, where data generated by the bot will be stored in JSON.
Then, to start the bot, simply run /src/main.py.
